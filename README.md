# InterEco

## What is InterEco?

InterEco is a tool to enable users to select and directly interact with underlying data and predictions generated by complex models. InterEco has great potential to facilitate nuanced interpretation, improve transparency and increase the impact of ecological research.

## How it works

All you need is your data and a model object. You use this to create a custom `appData` object.

Supported model types:

 * `lm()`

## Setting up your InterEco experience

Generate a study summary
```
generateTemplateSummary("test.Rmd")
```
Edit the resulting R markdown file with all the details of your study.

Create your InterEco `appData` object
```
appData <- makeAppData(data, model, pred, modx)
```

Create the app
```
generate_InterEco(appData)
```

Nice one
