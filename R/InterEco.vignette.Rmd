InterEco webpages consist of five tabs, as follows:

1) [Landing page]{.underline} - Here, you can describe the overall aim of the website, and who the intended audience is. You can also give details of and link to the published article or report that your website is associated with, and any funding details. The aim of this tab is to introduce the website and clearly state its purpose.

2) [Study summary]{.underline} - Here, describe the study's background and rationale for the research questions and state the taxonomic, spatial and temporal scope of the research. You can include important methodological details, including the study location, sampling design, and data collection procedures. Describe the environmental variables that are used in the statistical model. You can provide interactive maps to allow the user to explore the study area and distribution of study sites along environmental gradients. The aim of this tab is to give the reader enough information, so that they can understand the research question and what was done in the study. The amount of detail you provide may vary depending on whether you would like the website to standalone from your research article, and/or whether the article is open access.

3) [Validity]{.underline} - The validity tab contains useful figures that help confirm that the model complies with underlying assumptions concerning independence, collinearity and the absence of residual patterns. This tab serves to satisfy readers that wish to know more about the underlying data structure and model fit. We recommend including three types of figures, as well as accompanying text to explain what the figures show:

i) Pairs plots - a plot matrix comprising bivariate scatterplots for each variable combination. This allows the reader to evaluate potential collinearity in the dataset.

ii) Variance inflation factors (VIF) - a figure displaying the VIF scores of each variable in the model. This allows readers to view the factors by which the variance of model coefficients are "inflated" by the existence of correlations among the model variables. Readers can ascertain that the VIF values are below an acceptable threshold.

iii) Residual plots - Following Zuur & Ieno (2016), standardized residuals can be plotted against each independent variable in the model, variables not in the model, and against spatial and temporal variables (e.g., latitude and longitude). This plot allows the reader to confirm the absence of residual patterns.

iv) Marginal effect plots that display common support (following [Hainmueller et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/how-much-should-we-trust-estimates-from-multiplicative-interaction-models-simple-tools-to-improve-empirical-practice/D8CAACB473F9B1EE256F43B38E458706) (2018)). Marginal effect plots display the estimated coefficient of a focal variable and its confidence interval against values of a second variable. They indicate the statistical significance, uncertainty, magnitude, and direction of an effect across a full hypothetical range of the modifying variable, often a range from 3SD below to 3SD above the mean. Users should include a frequency histogram of the second variable along the *x*-axis, to allow the user to judge common support based on the distribution of that variable.

[4) Interpretation]{.underline} - Here you can help your readers to interpret your study results, giving them the options to interact directly with underlying data, and choose which variables and on which measurement scale to plot predictions. The InterEco guidelines provide important hints and tips for communicating results in a useful way. For example, it gives suggestions for visualising results using different scales of measurement (whether additive or multiplicative), depending on the research question. This tab will help to avoid misinterpretation of study results and avoid common inferential errors.

5) [Generality]{.underline} - Here you can describe and justify the target context to which your inferences can be validly transferred (also known as the applicability domain). The aim of this tab is to encourage authors to draw conservative inferences, rather than make broad generalizations about undefined or ill-defined target contexts. We recommend writing a "Constraints on Generality" (CoG) statement, where you can clearly specify the assumptions and conditions that must hold for inferences to transfer.
